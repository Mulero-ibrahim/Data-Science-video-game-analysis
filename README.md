The task is to predict the sales performance of several video games worldwide; to classify and cluster the video games based on some categorical variables.

Attempt the following questions


 1. Which of the variables in the video game dataset or a combination of them best predicts “global sales” of video games and why? Provide quantitative justifications for your answers.
 2. What effect will the number of critics and users as well as their review scores have on the sales of Video games in North America, EU and Japan?
 3. What propelled the choice of your regressor for this task? Aptly discuss with quantitative reasons!
 4. Use all the relevant categorical variables in the Video Game Dataset as the target variable at each instance and determine which of the variables performed best in classifying the dataset. Explain your findings.
 5. How did you check whether your models did not overfit?
 6. Can your classification models be deployed in practice based on their performances? Explain.
 7. In the video game dataset, use a relevant categorical variable and other relevant noncategorical variables to form groups at each instance. By employing internal and external evaluation metrics, determine which categorical variable best describes the groups formed.
