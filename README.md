# Video Game Sales Analysis

## Introduction

This analysis aims to predict the sales performance of video games worldwide and classify them based on certain categorical variables. The following questions are addressed to provide insights into the factors influencing video game sales:

### 1. Predicting Global Sales

The primary objective is to identify the variables or combinations thereof that best predict global sales. Quantitative justifications will be provided based on regression analysis. The chosen regressor will be discussed, supported by its quantitative performance metrics.

### 2. Impact of Critics and Users on Regional Sales

The influence of the number of critics and users, along with their review scores, on video game sales in North America, EU, and Japan will be examined. Quantitative assessments will be provided to elucidate the effects.

### 3. Choice of Regressor

The rationale behind selecting the specific regressor for predicting global sales will be discussed, substantiated by quantitative reasons, such as model performance metrics and validation procedures.

### 4. Classification of Video Game Dataset

The analysis involves using relevant categorical variables as target variables to classify the dataset. The goal is to determine which variable performs best in classifying the data, with detailed explanations supported by quantitative findings.

### 5. Overfitting Prevention

The measures taken to ensure the models do not overfit will be discussed, including validation techniques, cross-validation, and relevant metrics monitoring.

### 6. Deployment Viability of Classification Models

The feasibility of deploying the classification models in practical scenarios will be explained, considering their performances and any limitations. 

### 7. Group Formation and Evaluation

Using a relevant categorical variable and other noncategorical variables, groups will be formed in the video game dataset. Both internal and external evaluation metrics will be employed to determine which categorical variable best describes the formed groups.
